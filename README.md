# Dublicate-Question-finder-
This repository contains a machine learning application designed to detect duplicate questions based on the Quora dataset, which was provided on Kaggle for a competition. The model is built using an XGBoost classifier and has achieved an accuracy of 80%.

Dataset
The Quora Question Pairs dataset, available on Kaggle, contains question pairs that are either duplicates or non-duplicates. The goal is to determine whether a pair of questions is asking the same thing.

Model
The project utilizes the XGBoost classifier for the task of classifying duplicate questions. Features are engineered from the dataset, and the model is trained to predict whether a pair of questions is a duplicate.
